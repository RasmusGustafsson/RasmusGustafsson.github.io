title: "My research"
---

My name is Rasmus Gustafsson, and I am I working as a PhD Student at the Department of Political Science, at Aarhus University. I work within the section for political behavior research. \
\
My research interest concerns the effects of when politicians communicate about their lifestyle. Or what I term lifestyle cues. How does voters perceive it when politicians talk about what kind of food they like to eat, or what cultural consumption they have? Does voters with a certain social background prefer politicians whose lifestyles align with their own, or are the effects more general?
