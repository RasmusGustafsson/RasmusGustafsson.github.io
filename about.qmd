Who am I?\
\
I like sports a lot - particularly football and cycling. I also like to play football and cycle myself. I am a huge supporter of Manchester United, and the local team AGF. \
\
I like music as well, and are always on the lookout for the next interesting artists to follow. My taste covers a wide range of genres, all from Nigerian afro-beat, techno and mainstream pop. I have a guitar myself, but can't really play on it - it is still an ongoing project.
